## Master's Abstract

Humour is a complex cognitive process that can result in a positive emotional state of mirth that has several health benefits. Research and clinical trials use humour as treatment but never actually consider the large variabilities between different individuals. A reliable and objective measure of humour appreciation could benefit futures studies employing humour. In this study, 40 participants watched and rated humorous videos while their facial expressions were recorded. For each video clip, we extracted the movement, saliency and two measures of semantic distance. We used physiological reactions and video characteristics at three moments during the trial (beginning, middle, end of the video) to predict how funny (neutral, funny, very funny) the participant would rate the video. Video characteristics were good at predicting between neutral and humorous video but not the intensities of humorous video (accuracy=64.1%). The proportion of smiles was the only feature to fluctuate drastically in time, showing that physiological information is better to identify the humorous moment in the video. Smiles were also better than video characteristics to predict amusement intensities within humorous videos. Furthermore, this study shows that humour appreciation is impacted by how the previous video is perceived. Videos are perceived more funny when the one preceding is funnier (r=0.477, p<0.001). Smiling associated with a humorous video lasts until the middle of the following one showing that funniness is incremental and can last even when the humorous situation is completed. More than only lasting after the content, the correlation between smiles and funniness rating is stronger after the video (r=0.703, p<0.001) than during (r=0.324, p<0.001). This study supports that different humorous content can induce different emotional states. Using physiological information such as facial expression is easy to add to an experiment and would highly benefit further studies using humour.
